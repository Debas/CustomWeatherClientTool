# Custom Weather Client Tool
The solution has been developed in the dot net core platform. 
As per the assignment I have developed a consume rest application which will fetch the weather information based on city.

Process of execution:
1. Click on the .exe file and enter a city name (for example: delhi, pune).
2. It will fetch the city latitite and longitute from the in.json file (downloaded from https://simplemaps.com/data/in-cities) 
and fetch the tmparature and windspeed based on lat long.
